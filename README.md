# Howler NPR Player

## Description
Play today's stories from NPR's Morning Edition or All Things Considered shows. 

## To do
* Fix for mutliple stories sometimes playing simultaneously (after pressing each download button in succession?)
* Controls for jumping ahead or back X seconds, and for this to work on Apple Watch 
* Ability to change playback speed
* Prevention of first story playing after last has ended
* Make the list the main screen with controls in separate area and an indication of which story is playing
* Refactoring to remove commented code in player.js after confirmation that it's not needed.
* Removal of SiriWave code?
