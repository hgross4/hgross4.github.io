# Howler NPR Player

## Description
Play today's stories from NPR's Morning Edition or All Things Considered shows. 

## To do
* Fix for pause and play buttons not always being available (visible and clickable)
* Arbitrary seek within story
* Larger buttons to get show stories
* Ability to change playback speed
* Fix for being able to play mutliple stories simultaneously (after pressing each download button in succession?)
* Refactor to remove commented code in player.js after confirmation that it's not needed.
* Remove SiriWave code?
