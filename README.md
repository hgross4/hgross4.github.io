# Howler NPR Player

## Description
Play today's stories from NPR's Morning Edition or All Things Considered shows. 

## To do
* Ability to close stories list and return to main playback screen (or make the list the main screen with controls in separate area and an indication of which story is playing)
* Fix for story title overlapping the times played and remaining indicators
* Controls for jumping ahead or back X seconds, and for this to work on Apple Watch 
* Ability to change playback speed
* Prevention of first story playing after last has ended
* Padding around buttons to get show stories
* Fix for mutliple stories sometimes playing simultaneously (after pressing each download button in succession?)
* Refactoring to remove commented code in player.js after confirmation that it's not needed.
* Removal of SiriWave code?
